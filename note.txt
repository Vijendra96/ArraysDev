Array:
======


1.	int[] elements = new int[0]; //empty array
	empty array should be possible,

2.	int[] elements = new int[-10];
	you can't provide a negative value becouse of negative value is also a integer but it will give runtime Exception and that is 				NegativeArraySizeException.
	
3.	double d1 = new double[5.0]; //it will give compile time error becouse of array size is double.
	no matter type of array, size of the array should be interger.

4.	by default array is a derived datatype.
5.	enternally every array is derived datatype that is why we are using 'new' keyword.

6.	int[] a = null;
	int b[] = null;
	int[]c = null;
	all are correct to represent an array.

7.	int[] elements = new int[]; //array size mandotery.

8.	int[] x = new[]{10, 20, 30, 40, 50}; //it is absolutely possible.

9.	int[] x = new[5]{10, 20, 30, 40, 50}; //you should not specify size and elements together.

10.	to know the length of an array use length attribute. // System.out.println(x.length);
11.	inside an array length is an attribute.
